:summary: Pythran recently gained a significant improvment in its value range
          analysis. Let's discuss some implementation details through a bunch of
          examples.

Not every story begins with an issue, but this one does. And with a quite old
one! `#1059 <https://github.com/serge-sans-paille/pythran/issues/1059>`_ dates
back to October, 2018 :-) At that time, I was trying to efficiently compile some
kernels for a `scikit-image PR <https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/pull/3226>`_.

``_integ`` function from scikit-image
=====================================

This is the body of the ``_integ`` function, from the ``_hessian_det_appx.pyx``
file in `scikit-image <https://scikit-image.org/>`_. The original body is
written in `cython <https://cython.org/>`_, with a few annotations:

.. code-block:: cython

    # cython: wraparound=False

    cdef inline Py_ssize_t _clip(Py_ssize_t x, Py_ssize_t low, Py_ssize_t high) nogil:
        if(x > high):
            return high
        if(x < low):
            return low
        return x


    cdef inline cnp.double_t _integ(cnp.double_t[:, ::1] img, Py_ssize_t r, Py_ssize_t c, Py_ssize_t rl, Py_ssize_t cl) nogil:

        r = _clip(r, 0, img.shape[0] - 1)
        c = _clip(c, 0, img.shape[1] - 1)

        r2 = _clip(r + rl, 0, img.shape[0] - 1)
        c2 = _clip(c + cl, 0, img.shape[1] - 1)

        cdef cnp.double_t ans = img[r, c] + img[r2, c2] - img[r, c2] - img[r2, c]

        if (ans < 0):
            return 0
        return ans

The translation to python, and thus to pythran, would be:

.. code-block:: python

    #pythran export _integ(float64[::], int, int, int, int)
    import numpy as np
    def _clip(x, low, high):
        assert 0 <= low <= high
        if x > high:
            return high
        if x < low:
            return low
        return x

    def _integ(img, r, c, rl, cl):
        r = _clip(r, 0, img.shape[0] - 1)
        c = _clip(c, 0, img.shape[1] - 1)

        r2 = _clip(r + rl, 0, img.shape[0] - 1)
        c2 = _clip(c + cl, 0, img.shape[1] - 1)

        ans = img[r, c] + img[r2, c2] - img[r, c2] - img[r2, c]
        return max(0, ans)

Very little changes here: the type annotations disappear, as Pythran infers them
from the top-level function and its ``pythran export`` line. All Pythran
functions are ``nogil`` by default (this is a strong requirement).

The ``wraparound=False`` comment also get removed, and an assert got added.
That's the core of this post: range value analysis and its use to detect
wraparound.
Basically, Pythran supports wraparound by default to match Python's indexing
behavior. But to avoid the test cost, it also tries hard to compute the possible
value range for each expression in the AST.

In the case of ``_integ``, it would be great if Pythran could prove that, once
clipped, ``r``, ``c``, ``r2`` and ``c2`` are all positive, that way no check
would be needed. However, to know that, we need to know that ``low >= 0``. This
property always hold at the call site, but doing a call-site specific analysis
would be too much, so a gentle ``assert`` is helpful here.

Note that it's still valid Python, and Pythran can enable or disable asserts
using ``-DNDEBUG`` or ``-UNDEBUG``, so there's no extra cost for an assert.

Thanks to the assert, and to `PR #1522
<https://github.com/serge-sans-paille/pythran/pull/1522>`_ Pythran can compute
that ``_clip`` always returns a positive value, thus deducing that no wraparound
is involved. Note that each indexing expression is handled independently, unlike
the global ``wraparound=False`` decorator.


Basic Implementation
====================

Pythran range analysis is relatively simple: it does not support symbolic bounds
and only manipulates intervals. It is interprocedural given it computes the
range of the output, but without any assumption on the range of the arguments,
and the interprocedural analysis is not recursive. It has some built-in knowledge
about the value range of functions like ``len`` and ``range``, which proves to
be useful for practical cases.

Let's illustrate that analysis through an example:

.. code-block:: python

    def foo(a):
        assert a > 0
        b = c = 10
        while a > 0:
            a -= 1
            b += 1
        if b == 9:
            print("wtf")
        if b == 10:
            print("wtf")
        if b == 11:
            print("ok")
        return a, b, c

It's a control flow analysis, so it follows the control flow starting from the
function entry point. It first meets an ``assert``, so we register that ``1 <= a <= inf``
(remember, we only use intervals). Then, there's an assignment of constant
value, so we have:

.. code::

    1 <= a <= inf
    10 <= b <= 10
    10 <= c <= 10``

Then comes a ``while`` statement. A while usually has two successors: its body,
and the next statement. But in that case we evaluate the condition and see that
it always holds, because we have ``1 <= a``, so we first perform a first round
of the body, getting, through the two accumulation (let's drop ``c`` for the
sake of clarity):

.. code::

    0 <= a <= inf
    11 <= b <=11

Then we're back to the test. The condition no longer always hold, so we need to
make a decision! The idea here is to perform a *widening*, so we record current
state, and perform another round, getting ``-1 <= a <= inf; 12 <= b <= 12``.
Through the comparison of the two states, we can see the evolution of ``a``
(it shrinks towards ``-inf``) and ``b`` (it grows toward ``+inf``).
This maybe not super accurate, but it's a correct overestimate.
So we decide that right before the test, we have:

.. code::

    -inf <= a <= inf
    11 <= b <= inf

It's safe to apply the condition at the entry point too, so let's constraint our
intervals once more.

.. code::

    1 <= a <= inf
    11 <= b <= inf

We're back to the successors of the ``while``. It's an ``if``! Let's first check
that the condition may holdâ€¦ And it doesn't! Let's skip it then, and go further.
The next if is also never reached, so it's a skip again, and the final if may be
true (but we're not sure if it always is, remember that the intervals are an
over-estimation). So we need to visit both the true branch and the false branch
(i.e., in our case, the next statement). And merge the results.

As it turns out, there's no change in the if body, and the return statement only
consumes the equations without modifying them.

Running this code through ``pythran -P``, which optimizes the code
then prints the python code back, gives:

.. code-block:: python

    def foo(a):
        a_ = a
        assert (a_ > 0)
        b = 10
        while (a_ > 0):
            a_ -= 1
            b += 1
        if (b == 11):
            builtins.print('ok')
        return (a_, b, 10)

The two first prints have been removed, because they were guarded by conditions
that never hold.

Programming Nits
================

Using a naive control-flow based approach has some advantages. For instance, in the
following code:

.. code-block:: python

    def foo(a):
        if a > 12:
            b = 1
        else:
            b = 2
        if a > 1:
            b = 2
        return b

Because the analysis explores the control flow graph in a depth-first manner,
when visiting the children of ``if a > 12``, it finds ``if a > 1`` and knows
*for sure* that the condition holds, thus ending up with ``b == 2`` upon the
return. Then when visiting the ``else`` branch, it records ``b == 2`` and also
ends up with ``b == 2`` upon the return.

In the end, ``pythran -P`` on the above snippets yields:

.. code-block:: python

    def foo(a):
        return 2


Let's be honest, this algorithm is super greedy, and if we find a sequence of ``if``
statements, it has an exponential complexity (and this happens a soon as we
unroll a loop with a condition in its body). In that case we fall back to a
less accurate but faster algorithm, that performs a tree transversal instead of
a control-flow graph transversal. This approach performs an union of the states after each if,
which leads to ``-inf <= a <= inf; 1 <= b <= 2`` after the first ``if`` in the
example above.

Conclusion
==========

Use ``assert`` statements! Pythran can extract precious information from them,
and there's no runtime cost unless you ask so ;-)
